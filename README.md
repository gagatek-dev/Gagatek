**Gagatek is a new, embedded, columnar analytical engine (OLAP) designed for high-performance, real-time analytics where speed is paramount. Built on first principles, its goal is to deliver absurd analytical performance with radically low resource consumption.**

It is a direct response to the growing complexity and bloat of modern data systems.

### The Philosophy: Why Gagatek?

In a world where software becomes increasingly complex and simple tasks require massive infrastructure, Gagatek champions a return to the roots. To a time when elegance in code meant simplicity, and performance came from a deep understanding of the fundamentals, not from adding more layers of abstraction.

Gagatek doesn't try to be everything to everyone. It is designed to do one thing and do it better than anyone else: process massive amounts of analytical data with ruthless efficiency.

### Core Principles

* üöÄ **Blazing Performance:** A columnar architecture, combined with modern techniques like bitpacking, dictionary encoding, and vectorized processing, allows Gagatek to achieve speeds that seemed impossible for such a lightweight engine.

* üí° **Radical Simplicity:** A minimalist core, zero external dependencies, and distribution as a single, native binary. Gagatek is designed to be effortlessly embedded into any application‚Äîfrom PHP and Java to React Native.

* üß† **Efficient by Design:** Engineered from the ground up for a minimal memory and CPU footprint. It's ideal for edge computing, IoT devices, mobile applications, and anywhere else where resources are precious.

### Ideal Use Cases

Gagatek is built for scenarios where immediate data insights create a competitive advantage.

* **‚ö° Real-Time Analytics Dashboards:** Power interactive, sub-second dashboards directly from raw data without the need for complex, slow, and expensive data warehousing infrastructure.

* **üõí Next-Generation E-commerce:** Enable dynamic pricing, real-time fraud detection, and instant sales reporting without slowing down the main transactional database. Give your store an analytical edge.

* **üßë‚Äçüíª Interactive Data Exploration for Professionals:** Empower analysts, data scientists, and business leaders to explore large datasets on their own machines. Get answers in milliseconds, not minutes, and make data-driven decisions faster than ever before.

* **üì± Embedded Analytics (IoT & Mobile):** Perform complex analytics directly on edge devices or in mobile applications, providing powerful insights without relying on a constant cloud connection.

### Project Status

**As of July 2025:** We have a working internal prototype that has validated all core performance assumptions. Work is underway to prepare for a public, open-source release.

### Roadmap

- [x] Working Proof of Concept of the core engine
- [ ] Publication of the first official benchmarks against leading industry solutions.
- [ ] Open-sourcing the code under the AGPLv3 License.
- [ ] Release of the official API.
- [ ] Release of the first client libraries (PHP, Java, React Native).
- [ ] Launch of the official documentation site at `gagatek.dev`.
